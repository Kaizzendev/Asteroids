# Introduction


Hi I'm Miguel García and I'm a fullstack web developer trying to learn videogame development. 
I've tried to do a lot of ambitious projects but they get never finished so I decided to start wth the basics and develop this games to learn and keep my github repositories updated, thanks for reading and checkout my other repos, :)


## Asteroids

I'm not a big fan of this game but i consider it a good learning tool for game development so... I hope it's enough good for you!

You can play it in Itch.io or you can download it and play it
